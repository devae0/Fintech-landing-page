# 🚀 High-Performance Interactive Landing Page

A modern, responsive landing page project focused on delivering a seamless user experience through **Vanilla JavaScript** and advanced **CSS3**. This project serves as a showcase for building scalable UI components, theme management systems, and smooth scroll interactions.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

* **State Management (Dark Mode)**: Implemented a robust theme-switching logic that manipulates the DOM tree in real-time. By toggling classes on the `<body>` element, the site's entire color palette shifts dynamically while maintaining high accessibility standards.
* **Scroll-Driven Interactions**: Engineered an "observer-style" sticky header using `window.onscroll`. The navigation bar detects scroll depth to trigger visual transitions, improving user orientation and site aesthetics.
* **Advanced Flexbox Architecture**: Utilized CSS Flexbox for complex two-column layouts and responsive "pill" navigation systems, ensuring the design remains stable across all viewport sizes.
* **Performance-First JavaScript**: Focused on lightweight, vanilla JS to handle user events (clicks and scrolls) without the overhead of heavy external libraries.

## 🧩 Key Web Development Features

* **Dynamic Navigation**: A fixed header with transition effects and a custom-built "Log In" / "Get Started" action block.
* **Component-Based UI**: Segmented the HTML into clear sections (`header`, `article`, `features`, `footer`) for better maintainability.
* **Asset Optimization**: Custom CSS filters applied to SVG/PNG assets to ensure branding consistency across different themes.
* **Typography & Spacing**: Precise control over line-heights and font hierarchies using the 'Poppins' typeface to ensure a professional finish.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **HTML5**: Semantic tags for modern SEO and clean structure.
* **CSS3**: Custom properties, transitions, and layout engines.
* **JavaScript**: Event listeners, class manipulation, and scroll logic.

2. **VS Code**: Use the **Live Server** extension for real-time development.
3. **GitHub Pages**: This project is ready for one-click deployment via GitHub Pages.

## 🧠 Development Challenges Solved
* **Box-Sizing Conflicts**: Resolved padding-related width issues in fixed headers by implementing `border-box` calculations.
* **CSS Specificity**: Managed complex theme overrides to ensure dark-mode styles properly cascade over base light-mode elements.
